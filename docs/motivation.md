## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the position of **Technical Writer for Research and Development** at Siemens in Leipzig. With over 12 years of experience in technical communication, a strong academic background, and a passion for innovation in documentation workflows, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to your mission of building the networks of tomorrow.

In my previous roles, I have successfully **led migration projects** converting traditional Word-based documentation into modern, structured, and multilingual contentâ€”closely aligned with your product families **SIMARIS** and **SIVACON**. I specialize in **modular, reusable, and audience-centered documentation** that enables efficient content reuse, semantic structuring, and variant management. My current work with **Schema ST4** has deepened my expertise in structured authoring and multilingual delivery.

Academically, I hold a **Masterâ€™s degree in Technical Communication**, complemented by a **second Masterâ€™s in Translation Studies**. I bring hands-on experience with English and German documentation, always in compliance with strict regulatory standards (e.g. MDR, ISO 13485). I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams including **product management, development, UX, and translation** to ensure consistent, user-focused content delivery.

I have also taken on **coordination and leadership tasks**, supporting team members across distributed locations, and sharpening my communication and intercultural skills in fast-paced, multilingual environments.

With a second residence in **Hettstedt**, I am **flexible and available on-site in Leipzig**, and very enthusiastic about contributing my skills to one of the most forward-thinking tech teams in Europe.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support Siemensâ€™ documentation excellence with Docs-as-Code principles, international collaboration, and future-ready content.

Best regards,  
**Rosenver Yepez Arrieta**
